# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the performance of students from different schools after removing the grade 9 math and reading scores for one of the schools, Thomas High School.

The biggest effect, was on % Passing Reading. Before adjustments, it was 86% and after fixing the dataset, it dropped to 85.7%.

3- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?  
4- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:   
- Math and reading scores by grade:  
The grades have not changed since the ninth grades were replaced with NaN and no other grade has been changed.  
- Scores by school spending:  
The scores by school type have not changed, since very small amount of data have been removed from the dataset.    
- Scores by school size:  
The scores by school size have not changed, because the size of grade 9 students from Thomas High School were very small compared to the number of total students across all schools, as shown below.
